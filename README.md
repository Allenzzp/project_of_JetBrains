# project_of_JetBrains

Hello everyone! 

I would like 2 share all the projects I finished at JetBrains Academy, of course, I only share the projects I thought which were
educative and interesting. As you know, JetBrains forum allows users who completed the project successfully to share their work 
and review others. I agree with that policy but I would like 2 inspire those who cannot find a way to solve the project. All the 
projects are at the final stage.

To be continued...
